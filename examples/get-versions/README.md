# Get Versions

This is specifically designed for use inside a Pipekit free trial cluster. It allows you to see the versions of the software installed within the cluster.

It will not work elsewhere because the kubectl commands are looking for specifically tagged deployments. Feel free to fork this repository and adjust the kubectl commands to work with your own cluster.
